Concerningly, the latest research shows that getting the flu vaccine increases the risk of getting the coronavirus by 36%!!!

Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally \\u201cmay reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWhile influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.\\u201d Like I blogged about before, the flu shot is known to actually suppress your immune system.\",\n          \"A new report, sent to the White House science adviser, says the country should not rely on warm weather to stop contagion.The homebound and virus-wary across the Northern Hemisphere, from President Trump to cooped-up schoolchildren, have clung to the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic will fade in hot weather, as some viral diseases do.But the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in a public report sent to the White House, has said, in effect: Don\\u2019t get your hopes up. After reviewing a variety of research reports, a panel concluded that the studies, of varying quality of evidence, do not offer a basis to believe that summer weather will interfere with the spread of the coronavirus.The pandemic may lessen because of social distancing and other measures, but the evidence so far does not inspire confidence in the benefits of sun and humidity.  The report, sent to Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House and acting director of the National Science Foundation, was a brief nine-page communication known as a rapid expert consultation.Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California and a member of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies, said: \\u201cGiven current data, we believe that the pandemic likely will not diminish because of summer, and we should be careful not to base policies and strategies around the hope that it will.\\u201d\\u201cWe might very well see a reduction in spread in the beginning of the summer,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbut we have to be careful not to put that down to a changing climate \\u2014 it is plausible that such a reduction could be due to other measures put in place.\\u201dHuman behavior will be most important. Dr. David Relman, who studies host-microbe interactions at Stanford, said if a human coughs or sneezes enough virus \\u201cclose enough to the next susceptible person, then temperature and humidity just won\\u2019t matter that much.\\u201dThe report from the National Academies, independent agencies that advise the government and the public, cited a small number of well-controlled laboratory studies that show that high temperature and humidity can diminish the ability of the novel coronavirus to survive in the environment. But the report noted the studies had limitations that made them less than conclusive.It also noted that although some reports showed pandemic growth rates peaking in colder conditions, those studies were short and limited. A preliminary finding in one such study, by scientists at M.I.T., found fewer cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in warmer climates, but arrived at no definitive conclusion.\\u201cSpecially in the U.S., any effect, even in the summer months, may not be highly visible, so our real chance to stop this virus is indeed through taking quarantine measures,\\u201d said Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at M.I.T. who is a co-author of the study.The report sent to the White House also struck a cautionary note: \\u201cGiven that countries currently in \\u2018summer\\u2019 climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,\\u201d it said.Pandemics do not behave the same way seasonal outbreaks do. For the National Academies\\u2019 report, researchers looked at the history of flu pandemics as an example. \\u201cThere have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years \\u2014 two started in the Northern Hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall,\\u201d the report said. \\u201cAll had a peak second wave approximately six months after emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred.\\u201dOn March 16, President Trump said the virus might \\u201cwash\\u201d through in warmer weather.\\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, has expressed different opinions about the effect of summer on the virus, some more optimistic than others. In a live-streamed interview on Wednesday, Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of The Journal of the American Medical Association, asked him about the fall, which Dr. Fauci said would be very challenging, after a period this summer when \\u201cit\\u2019s almost certainly going to go down a bit.\\u201d\\nOn March 26, however, in a conversation on Instagram with Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, Dr. Fauci said that although it wasn\\u2019t unreasonable to assume the summer weather could diminish the spread, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t want to count on it.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 269,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.who.int\",\n          \"https://www.tierneyrealnewsnetwork.com/\",\n          \"https://www.forbes.com/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fake\",\n          \"TRUE\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime [sic] you feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to keep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation. Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C. The symptoms/description are: Repeated high fever. 2. Prolonged coughing after fever. 3. Children are more prone. 4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness.

We talked to Dr. Samir Sinha. He's the director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto. And this is what he says:Until there's a vaccine, the most vulnerable people should continue to stay home if they can. That includes grandparents over 60 like you and people with chronic illnesses.You see, people in those categories are more likely to become severely ill if they contract coronavirus. We don't want that to be you.\\\"I think the pandemic has been really hard for everybody, but social isolation is a particular issue for older adults,\\\" he says. \\\"One of the greatest joys for older people is seeing younger people in their lives and having intergenerational connections.\\\"It's a tricky balance, we know.On one hand, meaningful connections are hugely important -- they can enrich and even prolong your life. But seeing a loved one means you'll interact with people you haven't seen in weeks who've spent their isolation in a different environment than you. You have to decide whether that risk is worth it to you.Let's talk about it.Maybe you think we, your loving family members, have banned you from visiting.\\\"There is this tension between families where older people feel their families are being overprotective of them or infringing on their rights,\\\" Sinha says.It doesn't have to be a stalemate. Let's talk it out.\\\"It should be a shared choice,\\\" Sinha says. \\\"That person hears why their loved one actually wants to protect them, and this prompts a conversation and helps the person understand, 'While I'm worried about you getting Covid-19, I appreciate that you want to protect me from that.'\\\"Discuss why you want to visit and acknowledge the risk involved.Have you been staying home and limiting your exposures?Or have you had to work daily in environments that could expose them to the virus.If it's the second one, it's best to visit virtually.Follow the safest protocol.There's no way to ensure total safety. But there are steps we all can take to keep the risk as low as possible.Read over Sinha's recommendations, which he developed with the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council:Be well. Make sure you're not sick when you plan to visit, whether that means a runny nose, fever or stomach ache -- any form of illness. We won't let you visit if any of us are sick, either.Wear masks. Keep it on for the duration of your visit, if you can. If you're asymptomatic, masks help keep you from breathing out the virus. (And you can learn how to make your own.)Wash your hands. As soon as you walk in, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. As your family, we'll disinfect frequently touched surfaces before you arrive.Greet without touch. Try not to greet us with a kiss or hug, as hard as that may be to resist.Keep your distance. You know the drill: Keep at least six feet of distance. We know, it's weird.Sinha also recommends his older patients re-up their vaccinations, particularly against the flu and pneumonia.If you do come down with coronavirus, there's a higher chance you may also become infected with pneumonia or the flu at the same time. Multiple illnesses will stress out your immune system. Pace yourself when you're visiting. So, it's decided -- you're visiting. Now you may need to pick which family members get first dibs on you.When you visit multiple people, the possibility that you'll be exposed to the virus grows, Dr. William Schaffner told us. He's an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\\\"Start off with a few people, or just one at a time,\\\" Schaffner says. \\\"This is not the time to have a once-in-20-years family reunion.\\\"Here's another consideration that may sway your choice: Children younger than 5 may have trouble adhering to social distancing measures. If they (or you) can't resist bear hugs or slobbery cheek kisses, consider visiting families with older children, Sinha says. Let's meet outside.Schaffner suggests we choose the great outdoors as our reunion venue, like a park or garden where we can stay safely distant from others.Transmission is unlikely outside, as long as we're keeping 6 feet apart, thanks to constant air flow, Schaffner says. But it's best to wear a mask anyway to prevent asymptomatic transmission should we accidentally come close.One last thing: We, your doting relatives, love you dearly. These guidelines aren't ideal, and we've never had to do anything like this before. But if we take these measures now, we'll do our part to stop the spread of coronavirus. And when this pandemic is through, we can bring on the bear hugs again.Oh, and keep washing your hands.\",\n          \"Due to the Corona Virus, the polls will remain closed and the election is cancelled. Trump will remain president for the next 4 years.(Watch how quickly the epidemic is over)\",\n          \"Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 270,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.rt.com\",\n          \"https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/\",\n          \"https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Pandemic-Innovation\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"fake\",\n          \"Fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1129,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What is social distancing and why is it important? The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant.Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now \\u2014 every day matters \\u2014 our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients.\",\n          \"The coronavirus was created in the laboratory and is a biological weapon CORANAVIRUS: Amazing that it goes on TV ... Here is the confirmation that we were waiting for ... BIOLOGICAL WEAPON \",\n          \"Summer Is Coming, but the Virus Won\\u2019t Be Going Whatever effect warm weather has on the coronavirus, it won\\u2019t be enough to safely drop social restrictions.\\u201cEverybody hopes for seasonality\\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, Peter Juni of the University of Toronto acknowledged. Maybe, just maybe, the summer will diminish the spread of Covid-19.\\nBut a new study, by Dr. Juni, an epidemiologist, and his colleagues in Canada and Switzerland, offers very little encouragement for warm-weather worshipers. In countries around the world, his research found, variations in heat and humidity had little to no effect on the spread of the pandemic. Differences in how the disease spread were instead strongly associated with public health measures like social distancing and school closures.Several other studies have found or projected modest effects of warmer climates or the increase of sunlight in diminishing the spread of the coronavirus, but all have emphasized the need for public health interventions.One reason is that most of the world\\u2019s population has no immunity to the virus. \\u201cThis means the virus doesn\\u2019t need favorable conditions\\u201d to spread, Dr. Juni said.He and his colleagues did a forward-looking study in which they picked 144 countries or \\u201cgeopolitical areas\\u201d around the world and established the conditions that prevailed from March 7 to March 13 in terms of temperature, humidity and public health measures.Then they followed those countries and how cases of Covid-19 grew during the subsequent period of March 21 to March 27, after a 14-day incubation period for infections during the earlier period to cause disease.The countries varied from Canada to the tropics, but no effect for temperature was found. Humidity had a very weak connection to diminished spread, they found. But by far the most important in associations with a diminished spread of the disease were school closings, social distancing and restrictions on large gatherings.\\n\\u201cIn our study,\\u201d the researchers wrote in the study, published Thursday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, \\u201conly public health interventions were consistently associated with reduced epidemic growth, and the greater the number of co-occurring public health interventions, the larger the reduction in growth.\\u201dOther studies have reported mixed results on the effect of the weather and sunlight. One from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that humidity seemed to slow the spread of the virus. Qasim Bukhari, one of the authors of that study, said the new report was interesting, although limited by the short time span it covered. He said he and his colleagues \\u201calso stressed in our work that public health interventions are very important.\\u201dMark C. Urban, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, found summer weather, including ultraviolet light, had some effect on the virus and its spread, but said \\u201csocial interventions have by far the most important effect.\\u201dAnd a short report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that summer was not likely to slow the virus significantly.All of the studies acknowledge uncertainty and limitations in their findings. And none diminish the primacy of public health measures. Dr. Juni said that given the effectiveness of social restrictions, school-opening strategies should be very carefully planned and tested.\\u201cWe can\\u2019t have schools closed for more than a year and a half,\\u201d he said, but it is not yet known how best to reopen schools and what policies should be followed. Mistakes could mean that openings backfire, with devastating consequence for spread of the disease.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We talked to Dr. Samir Sinha. He's the director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto. And this is what he says:Until there's a vaccine, the most vulnerable people should continue to stay home if they can. That includes grandparents over 60 like you and people with chronic illnesses.You see, people in those categories are more likely to become severely ill if they contract coronavirus. We don't want that to be you.\\\"I think the pandemic has been really hard for everybody, but social isolation is a particular issue for older adults,\\\" he says. \\\"One of the greatest joys for older people is seeing younger people in their lives and having intergenerational connections.\\\"It's a tricky balance, we know.On one hand, meaningful connections are hugely important -- they can enrich and even prolong your life. But seeing a loved one means you'll interact with people you haven't seen in weeks who've spent their isolation in a different environment than you. You have to decide whether that risk is worth it to you.Let's talk about it.Maybe you think we, your loving family members, have banned you from visiting.\\\"There is this tension between families where older people feel their families are being overprotective of them or infringing on their rights,\\\" Sinha says.It doesn't have to be a stalemate. Let's talk it out.\\\"It should be a shared choice,\\\" Sinha says. \\\"That person hears why their loved one actually wants to protect them, and this prompts a conversation and helps the person understand, 'While I'm worried about you getting Covid-19, I appreciate that you want to protect me from that.'\\\"Discuss why you want to visit and acknowledge the risk involved.Have you been staying home and limiting your exposures?Or have you had to work daily in environments that could expose them to the virus.If it's the second one, it's best to visit virtually.Follow the safest protocol.There's no way to ensure total safety. But there are steps we all can take to keep the risk as low as possible.Read over Sinha's recommendations, which he developed with the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council:Be well. Make sure you're not sick when you plan to visit, whether that means a runny nose, fever or stomach ache -- any form of illness. We won't let you visit if any of us are sick, either.Wear masks. Keep it on for the duration of your visit, if you can. If you're asymptomatic, masks help keep you from breathing out the virus. (And you can learn how to make your own.)Wash your hands. As soon as you walk in, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. As your family, we'll disinfect frequently touched surfaces before you arrive.Greet without touch. Try not to greet us with a kiss or hug, as hard as that may be to resist.Keep your distance. You know the drill: Keep at least six feet of distance. We know, it's weird.Sinha also recommends his older patients re-up their vaccinations, particularly against the flu and pneumonia.If you do come down with coronavirus, there's a higher chance you may also become infected with pneumonia or the flu at the same time. Multiple illnesses will stress out your immune system. Pace yourself when you're visiting. So, it's decided -- you're visiting. Now you may need to pick which family members get first dibs on you.When you visit multiple people, the possibility that you'll be exposed to the virus grows, Dr. William Schaffner told us. He's an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\\\"Start off with a few people, or just one at a time,\\\" Schaffner says. \\\"This is not the time to have a once-in-20-years family reunion.\\\"Here's another consideration that may sway your choice: Children younger than 5 may have trouble adhering to social distancing measures. If they (or you) can't resist bear hugs or slobbery cheek kisses, consider visiting families with older children, Sinha says. Let's meet outside.Schaffner suggests we choose the great outdoors as our reunion venue, like a park or garden where we can stay safely distant from others.Transmission is unlikely outside, as long as we're keeping 6 feet apart, thanks to constant air flow, Schaffner says. But it's best to wear a mask anyway to prevent asymptomatic transmission should we accidentally come close.One last thing: We, your doting relatives, love you dearly. These guidelines aren't ideal, and we've never had to do anything like this before. But if we take these measures now, we'll do our part to stop the spread of coronavirus. And when this pandemic is through, we can bring on the bear hugs again.Oh, and keep washing your hands.\",\n          \"Due to the Corona Virus, the polls will remain closed and the election is cancelled.

Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.The contacts are notified about their exposure.

The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant.Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now \\u2014 every day matters \\u2014 our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients.\",\n          \"The coronavirus was created in the laboratory and is a biological weapon CORANAVIRUS: Amazing that it goes on TV ... Here is the confirmation that we were waiting for ... BIOLOGICAL WEAPON \",\n          \"Summer Is Coming, but the Virus Won\\u2019t Be Going Whatever effect warm weather has on the coronavirus, it won\\u2019t be enough to safely drop social restrictions.\\u201cEverybody hopes for seasonality\\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, Peter Juni of the University of Toronto acknowledged. Maybe, just maybe, the summer will diminish the spread of Covid-19.\\nBut a new study, by Dr. Juni, an epidemiologist, and his colleagues in Canada and Switzerland, offers very little encouragement for warm-weather worshipers. In countries around the world, his research found, variations in heat and humidity had little to no effect on the spread of the pandemic. Differences in how the disease spread were instead strongly associated with public health measures like social distancing and school closures.Several other studies have found or projected modest effects of warmer climates or the increase of sunlight in diminishing the spread of the coronavirus, but all have emphasized the need for public health interventions.One reason is that most of the world\\u2019s population has no immunity to the virus. \\u201cThis means the virus doesn\\u2019t need favorable conditions\\u201d to spread, Dr. Juni said.He and his colleagues did a forward-looking study in which they picked 144 countries or \\u201cgeopolitical areas\\u201d around the world and established the conditions that prevailed from March 7 to March 13 in terms of temperature, humidity and public health measures.Then they followed those countries and how cases of Covid-19 grew during the subsequent period of March 21 to March 27, after a 14-day incubation period for infections during the earlier period to cause disease.The countries varied from Canada to the tropics, but no effect for temperature was found. Humidity had a very weak connection to diminished spread, they found. But by far the most important in associations with a diminished spread of the disease were school closings, social distancing and restrictions on large gatherings.\\n\\u201cIn our study,\\u201d the researchers wrote in the study, published Thursday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, \\u201conly public health interventions were consistently associated with reduced epidemic growth, and the greater the number of co-occurring public health interventions, the larger the reduction in growth.\\u201dOther studies have reported mixed results on the effect of the weather and sunlight. One from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that humidity seemed to slow the spread of the virus. Qasim Bukhari, one of the authors of that study, said the new report was interesting, although limited by the short time span it covered. He said he and his colleagues \\u201calso stressed in our work that public health interventions are very important.\\u201dMark C. Urban, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, found summer weather, including ultraviolet light, had some effect on the virus and its spread, but said \\u201csocial interventions have by far the most important effect.\\u201dAnd a short report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that summer was not likely to slow the virus significantly.All of the studies acknowledge uncertainty and limitations in their findings. And none diminish the primacy of public health measures. Dr. Juni said that given the effectiveness of social restrictions, school-opening strategies should be very carefully planned and tested.\\u201cWe can\\u2019t have schools closed for more than a year and a half,\\u201d he said, but it is not yet known how best to reopen schools and what policies should be followed. Mistakes could mean that openings backfire, with devastating consequence for spread of the disease.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
