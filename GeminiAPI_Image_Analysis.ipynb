But then I discovered the magic of meal prepping, and my life (and waistline) have never been the same!\n> \n> Look at these beauties! These are two of my latest creations – perfectly portioned containers brimming with deliciousness.  Each one is packed with fluffy white rice, tender chunks of teriyaki chicken, vibrant orange and red bell peppers, and a generous helping of broccoli.  It's a balanced and flavorful meal that keeps me energized throughout the workday.  No more midday hunger pangs!\n> \n> My meal prep journey wasn't always this smooth.  It started with ambitious Pinterest boards and overly-complicated recipes that left me feeling overwhelmed and defeated.  I’ve learned a few key things along the way:\n> \n> * **Keep it simple:**  Don't try to recreate Michelin-star meals for your lunchbox.  Choose recipes with a few core ingredients that you enjoy.\n> * **Embrace repetition:**  Once I found a few winning combinations, I embraced making them repeatedly – it saves so much time!\n> * **Prep smart:**  Cook extra protein and veggies on the weekend, then assemble your containers on Sunday evening for easy grab-and-go lunches.\n> \n> Now, instead of dreading lunchtime, I look forward to it! Meal prepping has saved me money, improved my diet, and given me more time to focus on other things.  If you’re thinking about giving it a try, don’t hesitate!  Start small, be patient with yourself, and you’ll be enjoying delicious and healthy lunches in no time.  Trust me, the colorful containers are a bonus!\n"
